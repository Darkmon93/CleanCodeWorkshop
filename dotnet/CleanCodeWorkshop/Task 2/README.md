# Task 2

1. Analyze and try to understand the `Sanitize` method from `SanitizeTitleDirty` class (`SanitizeTitleDirty.cs` file)
2. Take a look at the refactored code from `SanitizeTitleClean` class (`SanitizeTitleClean.cs` file) and then go to `Sanitizer` class (`../Utils/Sanitizer.cs` file) and implement missing code fragments
3. Run the tests prepared for `Task 2` and check if they pass.

### Tips

1. Places where changes should be made are preceded by a `TODO` comments
2. When implementing the missing code fragments, you can follow the appropriate parts of the code from 1st file.
